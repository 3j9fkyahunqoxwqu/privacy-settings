network.websocket.enabled= Websockets can cause some dns requests to not be send over the active proxy.
network.http.sendSecureXSiteReferrer= Tells the server which https page the user came from.
dom.event.clipboardevents.enabled= Websites can get notifications if you copy, paste, or cut something from a web page, and it lets them know which part of the page had been selected.
browser.safebrowsing.enabled= Disable Google Safe Browsing and phishing protection. Security risk, but privacy improvement.
browser.safebrowsing.downloads.enabled= Disable Google Safe Browsing and phishing protection. Security risk, but privacy improvement.
browser.safebrowsing.malware.enabled= Disable Google Safe Browsing malware checks. Security risk, but privacy improvement.
browser.send_pings= Allows websites to track users clicks.
geo.enabled= Disables geolocation.
geo.wifi.logging.enabled= Disables logging geolocation requests.
privacy.trackingprotection.enabled= This is Mozilla's new built in tracking protection.
datareporting.healthreport.service.enabled= Stability and performance reports.
datareporting.healthreport.uploadEnabled= Stability and performance reports.
toolkit.telemetry.enabled= Usage statistics reports.
loop.enabled= Firefox Hello: Firefox connects to third-party (Telefonica) servers.
browser.pocket.enabled= Pocket Integration: A third-party service for managing a reading list of articles.
media.peerconnection.enabled= WebRTC can leak a users IP address from behind a VPN or proxy.
media.eme.enabled= A binary plugin that enables playback of encrypted media.
media.gmp-eme-adobe.enabled= A binary plugin that enables playback of encrypted media.
webgl.disabled= WebGL is a potential security risk.
security.ssl.treat_unsafe_negotiation_as_broken= This preference can be used to achieve visual feedback when connecting to a server that still utilises the old protocol version, not yet supporting the new, enhanced protocol version(s). When set to true, when connecting to such a server, Firefox will warn about "broken security" by displaying a red/broken padlock in its status bar. It should be noted that this indicator isn't of much help with regards to state of the connection used to retrieve the content. When you see the indicator, it's already “too late”, as a connection to that server has already been established and an attack may have already occurred.
security.ssl.require_safe_negotiation= This pref controls the behaviour during the initial negotiation between client and server. If set to true, a Mozilla client will reject all connection attempts to servers that are still using the old SSL/TLS protocol and which might be vulnerable to the attack.
security.tls.insecure_fallback_hosts.use_static_list= Web sites needing to fall back to an insecure version of TLS in order to work are now in a hardcoded whitelist which will shrink over time (bug 1114816). The whitelist can be disabled by setting security.tls.insecure_fallback_hosts.use_static_list  to false
security.tls.unrestricted_rc4_fallback= RC4 is now disabled when using TLS, except for a few specifically whitelisted Web sites. This whitelist is an interim measure until those sites are fixed (bug 1124039). This fallback is controlled by the security.tls.unrestricted_rc4_fallback preference, true by default for the moment
dom.battery.enabled= Enables websites to know information about the battery in your laptop or smartphone
beacon.enabled= Enables webpages to send data to a web server prior to the unloading of the document
network.dns.disablePrefetch= This feature allows Firefox to perform domain name resolution proactively and in parallel for hyperlinks, images, CSS, JavaScript, and other webpage content.
network.prefetch-next= Link prefetching is when a webpage hints to the browser that certain pages are likely to be visited, so the browser downloads them immediately so they can be displayed immediately when the user requests it
